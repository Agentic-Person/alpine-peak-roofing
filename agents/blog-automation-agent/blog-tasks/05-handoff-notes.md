# Blog Automation Agent - Handoff Notes

## 🎯 Project Status Update
**Developer:** Claude Code Assistant  
**Start Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Initial Setup & n8n Workflow Creation  
**Budget Target:** <$15 per blog post  

## 📋 Daily Progress Log

### September 7, 2025 - Initial Assessment & Setup
**Status:** In Progress

#### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Reviewed project requirements and documentation
- [x] Analyzed existing agentic blog workflow (noted it's overkill - needs simplification)
- [x] Verified n8n MCP server configuration in .mcp.json
- [x] Created project todo list for organized tracking
- [x] Created handoff notes file for progress documentation

#### 📊 Key Findings from Requirements Analysis
- **Critical Insight:** The existing `docs/agentic-blog-workflow-prompt.md` is far too complex for a <$15 per post budget
- **Simplification Needed:** 3-4 posts weekly vs. biweekly, 25+ RSS feeds vs. 3-5 sources, etc.
- **Cost Focus:** Must prioritize GPT-3.5-turbo for drafts, GPT-4 only for final polish
- **n8n MCP Requirement:** All workflows must use MCP server tools (confirmed available)

#### 🔄 Next Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Simplify Content Strategy**: Reduce complexity of existing workflow prompt
2. **Create blog-content-planner**: Biweekly cron workflow for topic selection
3. **Build blog-content-generator**: Cost-optimized content creation pipeline
4. **Set up blog-publisher**: Automated CMS publishing and distribution

#### 🚨 Critical Requirements Identified
- **Budget Constraint:** <$15 per post (including all AI, tools, distribution)
- **Frequency:** Biweekly posting (every 2 weeks) to control costs
- **AI Usage:** GPT-3.5 primary, GPT-4 sparingly for polish only
- **Research Sources:** Limit to 3-5 sources per post (vs. 25+ in original plan)
- **n8n MCP Only:** No web UI or other methods allowed for n8n work

#### 💡 Cost Optimization Strategy
Based on analysis, here's the simplified approach:
- **Content Planning**: Automated topic selection from limited sources
- **Research Phase**: 3-5 targeted sources instead of comprehensive monitoring
- **Content Generation**: GPT-3.5 for outline + draft, GPT-4 for final optimization
- **Distribution**: Basic social media + CMS publishing
- **Monitoring**: Simple analytics vs. complex performance tracking

- [ ] Supabase blog_posts table schema
- [ ] Social media API access (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- [ ] CMS publishing capabilities (Next.js API routes?)

## 📈 Success Metrics to Track
- **Cost per post**: Target <$15 (AI + tools + distribution)
- **Publishing consistency**: 100% biweekly schedule adherence  
- **Content quality**: Maintain SEO standards with reduced AI usage
- **Lead generation**: Target 5+ qualified leads per post
- **Workflow automation**: 95%+ automated publishing success rate

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Week 1: n8n Workflow Foundation
- [x] Day 1: Initial setup and requirements analysis
- [ ] Day 2: Create simplified content strategy
- [ ] Day 3: Build blog-content-planner workflow
- [ ] Day 4: Develop blog-content-generator workflow  
- [ ] Day 5: Set up blog-publisher workflow

### Week 2: Frontend & Integration
- [ ] Build blog listing and individual post pages
- [ ] Implement SEO optimization pipeline

## 💬 Notes for Next Developer
- The original workflow in `docs/agentic-blog-workflow-prompt.md` is comprehensive but exceeds budget
- Focus on essential features: topic selection → content generation → publishing
- Use n8n MCP server tools exclusively - no web UI or CLI alternatives
- Prioritize cost efficiency over feature completeness
- Document all API usage and costs for budget tracking
