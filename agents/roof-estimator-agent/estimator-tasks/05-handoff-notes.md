## üéØ Current Research Findings

### Google Maps Building Insights API
**Capabilities Confirmed:**
- Roof polygon extraction from satellite imagery
- Area calculations with high precision
- Building height and orientation data
- Solar potential analysis (useful for roof characteristics)

**Limitations Identified:**
- $0.10 per successful request cost
- 1,000 requests per day default limit
- Requires high-quality satellite imagery (may fail for some addresses)
- Limited to specific geographic regions

**Recommendation:** Implement with fallback to manual measurement input for edge cases.

### Cost & Performance Projections
**Estimated API Costs per 1000 Estimates:**
- Building Insights API: $100 (primary cost driver)
- Geocoding API: $5
- Static Maps API: $2
- Places API (Autocomplete): $3
- **Total API Cost: ~$110 per 1000 estimates**

**Target Performance Metrics:**
- 95% measurement accuracy (within 5% of professional estimates)
- 30-second end-to-end estimate generation
- 90%+ address geocoding success rate
- 98%+ email delivery rate
