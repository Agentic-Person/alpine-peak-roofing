- Gutters and downspouts
- Flashing and trim materials
- Ice and water barrier

### 4. Estimate Generation Requirements
**PDF Generation Features:**
- Professional branded estimate template

- Visual roof diagram/satellite image
- Terms and conditions
- Validity period (typically 30 days)

**Delivery Requirements:**
- Generate PDF within 30 seconds of calculation
- Automatic email delivery to customer
- SMS notification with estimate summary
- Copy stored in CRM for follow-up

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Requirements

materials: {
  id: uuid,
  category: 'shingles' | 'metal' | 'accessory',
  name: string,
  price_per_sqft: decimal,
  labor_multiplier: decimal,
  waste_factor: decimal,
  description: text,
  image_url: string
}
```

### 2. Estimate Storage
```sql
-- Estimates tracking table
roof_estimates: {
  id: uuid,
  address: string,
  coordinates: point,
  roof_area_sqft: decimal,
  selected_materials: jsonb,
  total_cost: decimal,
  customer_info: jsonb,
  pdf_url: string,
  created_at: timestamp,
  status: 'generated' | 'viewed' | 'contacted'
}
```

### 3. Regional Pricing Data
- Labor cost multipliers by ZIP code
- Permit fee schedules by municipality
- Material availability and delivery costs

5. Store measurements in database
6. Return structured measurement data

### 2. Estimate Calculator Workflow
**Trigger:** HTTP POST with measurements and material selections
**Steps:**
1. Retrieve current material pricing
2. Apply regional labor multipliers
3. Calculate waste factors and add-ons
4. Generate line-item cost breakdown
5. Create estimate record in database
6. Trigger PDF generation workflow

### 3. PDF Generator & Email Workflow
**Trigger:** New estimate record created
**Steps:**
1. Generate PDF from estimate template
2. Upload PDF to cloud storage
3. Send formatted email to customer
4. Send SMS notification (optional)
5. Create CRM lead record
6. Schedule follow-up reminders
