# Chatbot Agent - Handoff Notes

## 📝 Current Status
**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Developer:** [Not yet assigned]  
**Status:** Ready to begin development  
**Priority Level:** High  

## 🎯 Project Context
This is the AI Chatbot feature for Alpine Peak Roofing's demonstration website. The chatbot showcases advanced automation capabilities that we'll sell to other roofing companies. This needs to be impressive and fully functional.

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Start with n8n Workflows (MANDATORY)
1. **MUST use n8n MCP server tools** - no exceptions
2. Create the main `chatbot-message-processor` workflow first
3. Test webhook connectivity and basic message processing
4. Set up OpenAI integration within n8n
5. Document any MCP server issues immediately

### Priority 2: Frontend Development
1. Create basic ChatWidget component structure
2. Implement message display and input functionality  
3. Connect to n8n webhook endpoints
4. Test real-time messaging flow

## 🚨 Critical Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. n8n MCP Server Usage
- **Every workflow MUST be created using n8n MCP server tools**
- Do not use web UI or other methods for n8n workflow creation
- Document all n8n MCP interactions in the `workflows/` folder
- If MCP server issues arise, escalate immediately to senior developer

### 2. Performance Standards
- Messages must process in < 2 seconds
- Widget must load in < 1 second
- Lead scoring must be accurate and documented

### 3. Integration Points
- Supabase for conversation storage
- OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent responses
- CRM integration for lead management
- Email/SMS notifications for sales team

## 🔧 Technical Setup Required

### Environment Variables Needed
```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# n8n Configuration  
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### Potential Challenges
1. **n8n MCP Server Connectivity**
   - May need to troubleshoot MCP server configuration
   - Document any connectivity issues for senior developer

2. **OpenAI API Rate Limits**
   - Monitor token usage to control costs
   - Implement proper error handling for rate limit hits
   - Consider caching common responses

3. **Real-time Messaging**
   - WebSocket setup may be complex
   - HTTP polling is acceptable fallback
   - Focus on functionality first, optimization later

### Performance Considerations
- Large conversation histories may slow down response times
- File uploads need size limits and compression
- Mobile performance requires careful optimization

## 🔍 Testing Priority

### Must Test First
1. Basic message send/receive flow
2. n8n workflow execution and response
3. Lead scoring calculation accuracy
4. Database conversation storage

### Can Test Later
1. Advanced UI animations
2. File upload edge cases
3. Mobile-specific optimizations
4. Error boundary components

## 📞 Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate to Senior Developer
1. **n8n MCP server connection issues** - immediate escalation
2. **OpenAI API integration problems** - escalate within 4 hours
3. **Database schema questions** - escalate within same day
4. **Architecture decisions** - discuss before implementing

### How to Document Blockers
1. Update this handoff notes file with specific issue
2. Include error messages, screenshots, or logs
3. Describe what was attempted to resolve
4. Estimate impact on timeline

## 💡 Success Tips

### Development Best Practices
1. **Start simple** - get basic message flow working first
2. **Test frequently** - verify each component as you build it
3. **Document as you go** - update handoff notes with progress
4. **Use TypeScript strictly** - leverage type safety throughout
5. **Follow existing patterns** - use established components and utilities

### Communication Guidelines
1. **Update task checklists** regularly in markdown files
2. **Ask questions early** rather than guessing
3. **Share progress updates** in handoff notes
4. **Document decisions** and reasoning for future developers
