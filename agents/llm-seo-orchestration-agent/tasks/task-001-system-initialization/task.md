      "passThreshold": "100% criteria met"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Create Communication Protocols

**File:** `communication-protocols.md`

```markdown
# Inter-Agent Communication Protocols
## Alpine Peak Roofing LLM-SEO Project

### Communication Standards

#### Status Reporting Format:
```json
{
  "agentId": "phase-X-agent-name",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-08T10:30:00Z",
  "phase": X,
  "status": "pending|in_progress|completed|blocked",
  "currentTask": "task-XXX-description",
  "progress": {
    "tasksCompleted": X,
    "totalTasks": Y,
    "percentComplete": Z
  },
  "blockers": [
    {
      "description": "Dependency issue description",
      "blockingAgent": "phase-X-agent", 
      "resolution": "Required action for resolution"
    }
  ],
  "nextMilestone": {
    "description": "Next major deliverable",
    "estimatedCompletion": "2024-01-XX"
  },
  "qualityMetrics": {
    "brandConsistency": "pass|fail",
    "technicalValidation": "pass|fail", 
    "seoOptimization": "pass|fail"
  }
}
```

#### Dependency Management:
- Phase 1 blocks all other phases until foundation schemas complete
- Phase 2 & 3 can run in parallel after Phase 1
- Phase 4 can run parallel with Phases 2-3 after Phase 1
- Phase 5 requires Phase 1 & 2 completion

#### Conflict Resolution:
1. Technical conflicts → Escalate to Orchestration Agent
2. Brand inconsistencies → Halt work, align with brand-assets.json
3. Resource conflicts → Orchestration Agent prioritizes
4. Timeline conflicts → Reassess dependencies and parallelize where possible

#### Quality Assurance Gates:
Each agent must pass QA before proceeding:
- Brand Voice Consistency Check
- Technical Accuracy Validation
- SEO Optimization Review
- Integration Testing
- User Experience Verification
```

## Step 5: Create Task Folder Structure

Create the following folder structure for each agent:

### Structured Data Agent (Phase 1):
```bash
mkdir -p agents/structured-data-agent/tasks/task-001-primary-business-schema

mkdir -p agents/structured-data-agent/tasks/task-004-sustainability-schema
mkdir -p agents/structured-data-agent/tasks/task-005-emergency-service-schema
mkdir -p agents/structured-data-agent/tasks/task-006-review-rating-schema
mkdir -p agents/structured-data-agent/tasks/task-007-faq-schema
mkdir -p agents/structured-data-agent/tasks/task-008-portfolio-schema

mkdir -p agents/content-depth-agent/tasks/task-008-case-studies
```

### Local SEO Agent (Phase 3):
```bash
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-001-community-pages
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-002-weather-intelligence
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-003-local-entities
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-004-service-areas
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-005-competitor-analysis
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-006-local-testimonials
mkdir -p agents/local-seo-agent/tasks/task-007-emergency-response
```

### Technical Enhancement Agent (Phase 4):
```bash
mkdir -p agents/technical-enhancement-agent/tasks/task-001-core-web-vitals
mkdir -p agents/technical-enhancement-agent/tasks/task-002-advanced-schemas
mkdir -p agents/technical-enhancement-agent/tasks/task-003-sustainability-tech

### Content Publishing Agent (Phase 5):
```bash
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-001-blog-automation
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-002-seasonal-automation
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-003-premium-strategy
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-004-llm-optimization
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-005-authority-campaigns
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-006-local-publishing
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-007-analytics-system
mkdir -p agents/content-publishing-agent/tasks/task-008-distribution-network
```
