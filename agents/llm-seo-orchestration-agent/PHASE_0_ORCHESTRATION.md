### Inter-Agent Data Sharing:
```
agents/shared-data/
├── brand-assets.json          # Logo, colors, imagery guidelines
├── service-definitions.json   # All services with pricing tiers
├── geographic-data.json       # All service areas with demographics
├── content-templates.json     # Approved content patterns
└── completion-tracker.json    # Task status across all phases
```

### Status Reporting Format:
```json
{
  "agent": "phase-X-agent-name",
  "phase": "X",
  "status": "in-progress|completed|blocked",
  "tasks_completed": "X/Y",
  "blockers": ["dependency issues"],
  "next_milestone": "description",
  "estimated_completion": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

### Quality Gates:
Each phase must pass QA checkpoints:
- **Brand Consistency** - Matches premium mountain positioning
- **Technical Accuracy** - Code/markup validates correctly
- **Content Quality** - Meets luxury market standards
