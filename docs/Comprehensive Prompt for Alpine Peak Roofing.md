# Comprehensive Prompt for Alpine Peak Roofing - Full Website with AI Automations Showcase
Do some research on some of the top roofing contractor websites in the United States of America for comparisons. 
Many of these websites have extensive imagery and photo-realistic representations of their roofing services and details of 
their roofing projects. We want to mimic this imagery and create a foundational website for Alpine Peak Roofing Company 
that provides beautiful imagery as far as final products, but also imagery in problematic roofing areas, diagrammatic 
escriptions to help out homeowners understand parts of their roofs where roofs go bad in the valleys, gables, whatever 
it is, ice dams. So we want to focus heavily on creating rich graphical imagery and descriptive representations. 

## Project Overview
Create a complete, professional mock roofing company website for "Alpine Peak Roofing" that functions as both a 
realistic roofing contractor site AND a demonstration platform for AI automation solutions. The website should 
be indistinguishable from a real roofing company's site while seamlessly integrating four revolutionary AI features 
that potential clients can experience firsthand.
